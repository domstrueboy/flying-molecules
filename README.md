# flying-molecules
Flying molecules! Different ways of solving the equations of motion! Intermolecular interaction! Hurry to see! for fun

flyingMolecules.m - subj;
flyingMoleculesMapForming.m - the same, but is formed from molecules map file with the matrix;
BrownianMotion.m - Brownian motion, every molecule moving to random direction, without interaction;

map.m - map file for flyingMoleculesMapForming.m;
data.m - tucked away in a separate file variables (but why?) for flyingMoleculesMapForming.m;
map.bmp - bitmap for the future, to form a map is not out of the matrix, but directly from the image.
